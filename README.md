## Basic idea

Im working with anyone who wants to participate in the building of a Hacking VideoGame with real labs behind it.

The labs are going to be raised by Docker or Virtual Machines and they should be integrated inside the game.

The videogame will be created using web technologies and it should allow anyone to develop new unofficial levels.

Levels are going to have an addon system so they could be installed to make the game grow infinitely.

All the levels should provide at least three "entrypoints" to let other developers use that entrypoint as a start point for the new developed level.

## Developers Platform

In order to provide level namespaces and a centraliced place to in a future share information and new levels a developer platform it's going to be created where Level Creators should register their levels before crearting it in order to get a special level key and avoid name collisions.
